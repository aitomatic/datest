# OpenSSM Examples

These are example *user code* that uses OpenSSM. They serve two main funcdtions:

1. To provide examples for users to learn how to use and leverage OpenSSM for their own work.

2. To provide a use-case-driven design for the development of OpenSSM itself.

See the associated `Makefile` for how to build and use these examples.
