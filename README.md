# Natest: Pytest-Inspired Testing Framework for Dana
*Comprehensive testing for Dana agents - because intelligent systems need intelligent testing*

---
> **What if testing agent-first neurosymbolic systems was as intuitive as testing Python?**

Traditional testing frameworks don't natively support Dana (.na) files. Natest bridges this gap by providing a minimal, pytest-inspired testing framework specifically designed to discover, parse, and execute Dana test files with familiar pytest-like patterns.

## TL;DR - Get Running in 30 Seconds! 🚀

```bash
pip install natest
# If you see an 'externally-managed-environment' error on macOS/Homebrew Python, use:
# pip install natest --break-system-packages
# Or use a virtual environment:
# python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install natest
natest start
```

*No repo clone required. This launches the Natest framework instantly.*

## Why Natest?

Natest provides a minimal, focused testing framework for Dana files:
- **📁 File Discovery**: Automatically finds and runs `.na` test files
- **🔍 Pytest-Inspired**: Familiar patterns and command-line interface
- **⚡ Simple**: Minimal dependencies, focused on core functionality
- **🎨 Rich Output**: Colored terminal output for clear test results
- **🔧 Extensible**: Optional LLM integration for advanced Dana testing
- **📋 Standards**: Follows pytest conventions where possible

## Core Innovation: Simple Dana File Testing

Natest provides a minimal framework for testing Dana (.na) files:

```bash
# Traditional testing: No .na file support
pytest test_example.py  # Only Python files

# Natest: Direct .na file testing
natest test_example.na  # Native Dana file execution
natest tests/           # Run all .na files in directory
natest --debug test.na  # Debug Dana file execution
```

**File Discovery**: Automatic .na file detection:
```bash
# Natest finds and runs Dana test files
natest tests/
# Runs: test_basic.na, test_advanced.na, etc.
```

**Pytest Integration**: Use both frameworks together:
```bash
# Python integration tests
pytest tests/

# Dana file tests  
natest tests/

# Combined workflow
make test  # Runs both pytest and natest
```

**Rich Output**: Clear, colored test results:
```bash
natest test_example.na
✅ test_basic_math ... PASSED
❌ test_advanced_logic ... FAILED
📊 2 tests, 1 passed, 1 failed
```
