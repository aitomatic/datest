# Natest: Pytest-Inspired Testing Framework for Dana
*Comprehensive testing for Dana agents - because intelligent systems need intelligent testing*

---
> **What if testing agent-first neurosymbolic systems was as intuitive as testing Python?**

Traditional testing frameworks fall short when it comes to Dana's agent-first neurosymbolic language. Natest bridges this gap by providing a pytest-inspired testing experience specifically designed for Dana's unique features: agent behaviors, reason() calls, context-aware functions, and self-improving pipelines.

## TL;DR - Get Running in 30 Seconds! 🚀

```bash
pip install natest
# If you see an 'externally-managed-environment' error on macOS/Homebrew Python, use:
# pip install natest --break-system-packages
# Or use a virtual environment:
# python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install natest
natest start
```

*No repo clone required. This launches the Natest framework instantly.*

## Why Natest?

Natest transforms Dana testing from ad-hoc validation to systematic, reliable verification through purpose-built testing primitives:
- **🤖 Agent-Native**: Purpose-built for testing multi-agent Dana systems
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Built-in verification for reason() calls and agent behaviors
- **⚡ Fast**: 10x faster test development with Dana-aware assertions
- **🧠 Context-Aware**: Test reason() calls that adapt output types automatically
- **🔄 Self-Improving**: Test functions that learn and optimize through POET
- **🌐 Domain-Expert**: Test specialized Dana agent knowledge and expertise
- **🔍 Transparent**: Every agent interaction is visible and debuggable
- **🤝 Collaborative**: Share and reuse working test suites across Dana projects

## Core Innovation: Dana-Native Testing

Natest provides Dana-native testing primitives that understand agent behaviors, reason() calls, and neurosymbolic operations:

```python
# Traditional testing: Opaque, brittle
def test_agent():
    result = agent.process(data)
    assert result is not None  # Limited validation

# Natest: Transparent, comprehensive with Dana-aware assertions
def test_agent():
    with natest.agent_context(agent) as ctx:
        result = ctx.reason("analyze data", context=data)
        
        # Test agent reasoning
        assert ctx.reasoning_steps > 2
        assert ctx.confidence > 0.8
        assert isinstance(result, dict)
        
        # Test context awareness
        detailed: dict = ctx.reason("analyze data", context=data)
        summary: str = ctx.reason("analyze data", context=data)
        assert detailed != summary  # Different types, same reasoning
```

**Dana-Native Testing**: Test agents as first-class entities:
```python
@natest.agent_test
def test_financial_analyst():
    agent = FinancialAnalyst()
    portfolio = load_test_portfolio()
    
    # Test agent capabilities
    assessment = agent.assess_portfolio(portfolio)
    assert_agent_reasoning(assessment, min_confidence=0.9)
    assert_agent_context_used(agent, portfolio)
```

**Context-Aware Validation**: Test reason() calls with type awareness:
```python
@natest.reason_test
def test_portfolio_analysis():
    portfolio = test_portfolio()
    
    # Test different return types from same reasoning
    risk_score: float = reason("assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio)
    risk_details: dict = reason("assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio) 
    risk_report: str = reason("assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio)
    
    # Validate type-specific behavior
    assert 0.0 <= risk_score <= 1.0
    assert "risk_factors" in risk_details
    assert "Portfolio Risk Assessment" in risk_report
```

**Self-Improving Pipeline Testing**: Test POET optimization:
```python
@natest.poet_test
def test_pipeline_learning():
    pipeline = portfolio | risk_assessment | recommendation_engine
    
    # Test baseline performance
    baseline_result = pipeline.process(test_data)
    
    # Simulate learning
    pipeline.learn_from_feedback(expert_feedback)
    
    # Test improvement
    improved_result = pipeline.process(test_data)
    assert_improvement(improved_result, baseline_result)
```
