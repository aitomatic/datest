# Error Handling - Standards & Patterns

## Error Handling Standards

Every error message must follow this template:
"[What failed]: [Why it failed]. [What user can do]. [Available alternatives]"

Example:
"Dana module 'math_utils' not found: File does not exist in search paths. 
Check module name spelling or verify file exists. 
Available modules: simple_math, string_utils"

## Requirements

- Handle all invalid inputs gracefully
- Include context about what was attempted
- Provide actionable suggestions for resolution
- Test error paths as thoroughly as success paths

## Diagnostic Verification

- For complex issues, verify diagnoses before making code changes
- Add logging statements to confirm assumptions
- Write temporary test cases to validate behavior
- Run relevant test suites to ensure no regressions
- Use debugger breakpoints when needed
- Document verification steps taken
