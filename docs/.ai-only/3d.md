# 3D Methodology (Design-Driven Development)

**3D = Design-Driven Development**: A rigorous methodology ensuring quality through comprehensive design documentation, iterative implementation phases, and strict quality gates.

Core principle: Think before you build, build with intention, ship with confidence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands
```bash
# Core development workflow
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .    # Lint and format
uv run pytest tests/ -v                        # Run tests with verbose output
uv run python -m dana.dana.exec.repl        # Dana REPL for testing
```

## üìã ALWAYS Create Design Document First

For any feature/system implementation, create two documents:

1. **Design Document**: `[feature_name].md`
   - Contains the design specification
   - Documents the architecture and approach
   - Defines requirements and constraints

2. **Implementation Tracker**: `[feature_name]-implementation.md`
   - Tracks implementation progress
   - Contains design review status
   - Monitors quality gates
   - Records decisions and changes

### Design Document Template
```markdown
# Design Document: [Feature Name]

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (~15-20%)
- [ ] Define core components and interfaces
- [ ] Create basic infrastructure and scaffolding

## üìä Implementation Tracking

For design review and implementation tracking, see:
- [3D Build Tracker](3d-build.md) - Active project tracking and progress monitoring

The build tracker includes:
- Design review status and checklists
- Implementation progress by phase
- Quality gates and validation criteria
- Technical debt monitoring
- Project status overview
- Recent updates and decisions
- Upcoming milestones

## üìÅ Documentation & Examples Organization

For detailed directory structures and organization guidelines, see:
- [Documentation Structure Reference](documentation_structure.md)
- [Examples Structure Reference](examples_structure.md)

### Organization Guidelines
- **Major Features**: Independent systems that warrant their own directory (e.g., POET, Dana Language)
- **Subsystems**: Components of larger systems (e.g., parser, interpreter within Dana)
- **Examples Mirror Documentation**: Same directory structure for easy cross-referencing
- **Documentation Cites Examples**: All user-facing docs should reference working examples

## üìö Example Creation Guidelines

### üéØ Purpose-Driven Examples

Examples are created in **Phase 6** after core implementation is complete and stable. Every example must serve a **specific learning objective** and follow the **Progressive Disclosure** principle:

```
üéì **LEARNING PROGRESSION**:
1. Start with minimal working example
2. Add complexity gradually
3. Explain each addition
4. Show real-world usage
5. Demonstrate best practices
```

### Example Structure
```
examples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [major_feature]/         # For large efforts (e.g., examples/poet/)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Overview and navigation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_hello_world/     # Minimal working examples
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_basic_usage/     # Common patterns
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_real_world/      # Production-like scenarios
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_advanced/        # Complex scenarios
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ troubleshooting.md  # Common issues
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/              # Example validation tests
```

### Example Requirements
- **Working Code**: All examples must be runnable and tested
- **Clear Purpose**: Each example demonstrates specific concepts
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from simple to complex
- **Real-World Context**: Show practical applications
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate recommended patterns
- **Error Handling**: Include error cases and recovery
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations and comments
- **Tests**: Validation tests for each example

## üìù Logging Standards

### Core Logging Principles
- **ALWAYS use `Loggable` mixin** for Python classes that need logging
- **NEVER use `DXA_LOGGER` directly** in class implementations
- **Use `log()` function** for Dana code debugging
- **Apply consistent log levels** across the codebase

### Loggable Mixin Usage
```python
from opendxa.common.mixins.loggable import Loggable

class MyClass(Loggable):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # Initialize Loggable mixin
        self.info("Initializing MyClass")
    
    def process_data(self, data: list[str]) -> str:
        self.debug(f"Processing {len(data)} items")
        try:
            result = self._process(data)
            self.info(f"Successfully processed {len(data)} items")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.error(f"Failed to process data: {e}")
            raise
```

### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARNING**: Unexpected but handled situations
- **ERROR**: Errors that need attention
- **CRITICAL**: System-level failures

### Best Practices
1. **Class-Level Logging**:
   - Inherit from `Loggable` for all classes needing logging
   - Initialize mixin in `__init__` with `super().__init__()`
   - Use `self.debug()`, `self.info()`, etc. for logging

2. **Dana Code Logging**:
   - Use `log()` function instead of `print()`
   - Include context in log messages
   - Use appropriate log levels

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Log errors with full context
   - Include stack traces for debugging
   - Provide actionable error messages

4. **Performance**:
   - Use appropriate log levels to control verbosity
   - Avoid expensive operations in debug logs
   - Consider log rotation and cleanup

### Quality Gates
- ‚úÖ All classes using logging inherit from `Loggable`
- ‚úÖ No direct `DXA_LOGGER` usage in class implementations
- ‚úÖ Consistent log levels across codebase
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error logging with context
- ‚úÖ Performance impact of logging assessed
