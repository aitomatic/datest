## Problem Statement
**Brief Description**: [1-2 sentence summary of the problem]

- Current situation and pain points
- Impact of not solving this problem  
- Relevant context and background
- Reference any related issues or discussions

## Goals
**Brief Description**: [What we want to achieve]

- Specific, measurable objectives (SMART goals)
- Success criteria and metrics
- Key requirements
- Use bullet points for clarity

## Non-Goals
**Brief Description**: [What we explicitly won't do]

- Explicitly state what's out of scope
- Clarify potential misunderstandings
- What won't be addressed in this design

## Proposed Solution
**Brief Description**: [High-level approach in 1-2 sentences]

- High-level approach and key components
- Why this approach was chosen
- Main trade-offs and system fit
- **KISS/YAGNI Analysis**: Justify complexity vs. simplicity choices

## Proposed Design
**Brief Description**: [System architecture overview]

### System Architecture Diagram
<!-- mermaid markdown -->
[Create ASCII or Mermaid diagram showing main components and their relationships]
<!-- end mermaid markdown -->

### Component Details
**Brief Description**: [Overview of each major component and its purpose]

- System architecture and components
- Data models, APIs, interfaces
- Error handling and security considerations
- Performance considerations

**Motivation and Explanation**: Each component section must include:
- **Why this component exists** and what problem it solves
- **How it fits into the overall system** architecture
- **Key design decisions** and trade-offs made
- **Alternatives considered** and why they were rejected
- **Don't rely on code to be self-explanatory** - explain the reasoning

### Data Flow Diagram (if applicable)
<!-- mermaid markdown -->
[Show how data moves through the system]
<!-- end mermaid markdown -->

## Proposed Implementation
**Brief Description**: [Technical approach and key decisions]

- Technical specifications and code organization
- Key algorithms and testing strategy
- Dependencies and monitoring requirements

## Design Review Checklist
**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Complete

Before implementation, review design against:
- [ ] **Problem Alignment**: Does solution address all stated problems?
- [ ] **Goal Achievement**: Will implementation meet all success criteria?
- [ ] **Non-Goal Compliance**: Are we staying within defined scope?

- [ ] **Security review completed**
- [ ] **Performance impact assessed**
- [ ] **Error handling comprehensive**
- [ ] **Testing strategy defined**
- [ ] **Documentation planned**
- [ ] **Backwards compatibility checked**
